# ADR Format

ADRs live in `docs/adr/` and use sequential numbering: `0001-slug.md`, `0002-slug.md`, etc. Create the directory lazily — only when the first ADR is needed.

## Template

```md
# {Short title of the decision}

{1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.}
```

That's it. An ADR can be a single paragraph. The value is in recording *that* a decision was made and *why*.

## Optional sections

- **Status** frontmatter (`proposed | accepted | deprecated | superseded by ADR-NNNN`)
- **Considered Options** — only when rejected alternatives are worth remembering
- **Consequences** — only when non-obvious downstream effects need calling out

## Numbering

Scan `docs/adr/` for the highest existing number and increment by one.

## When to offer an ADR

All three must be true:

1. **Hard to reverse** — the cost of changing your mind later is meaningful
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader will wonder why
3. **The result of a real trade-off** — genuine alternatives existed

If a decision is easy to reverse, not surprising, or had no real alternative, skip it.
